# Habitrack
I want to make a habit tracker for my 2024 annual goals.

# Todos:
- get selector either embedded or to have a back arrow to get there
- make entries editable
- create summary pages
  - graphs
  - summary stats
  - comparison to goal
- maybe have a dashboard
- date timezone issue
- look of update page
- make update update and not just add a new one
- add habits

# Tolearns:
- actual substantial requests 
- blocks in templates if that's a thing
