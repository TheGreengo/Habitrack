# Habitrack
I want to make a habit tracker for my 2024 annual goals.

# Todos:
- get selector either embedded or to have a back arrow to get there
- make entries editable
- create summary pages
  - graphs
  - summary stats
  - comparison to goal
- maybe have a dashboard

# Long term fixes:
- date timezone issue
- title for calendar pages
- look of update page
- back arrow to select page
- fix day formatting
- make update update and not just add a new one

# Tolearns:
- actual substantial requests 
- blocks in templates if that's a thing
