# Habitrack
I want to make a habit tracker for my 2024 annual goals.

# Todos:
- generate list of dated entries 
- conditionally render days based off of entries
  - late ones gray
  - upcoming ones something
  - days marked a different color
- see if there's a way to embed templates within each other
- get selector either embedded or to have a back arrow to get there
- make some sort of fill outable thing if you click on a particular day
- make that create a new entry
- make entries editable
- create summary pages
  - graphs
  - summary stats
  - comparison to goal
maybe have a dashboard
