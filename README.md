# Habitrack
I want to make a habit tracker for my 2024 annual goals.

# Todos:
- see if there's a way to embed templates within each other
- get selector either embedded or to have a back arrow to get there
- make some sort of fill outable thing if you click on a particular day you can log that days info
- make that create a new entry
- make entries editable
- create summary pages
  - graphs
  - summary stats
  - comparison to goal
- maybe have a dashboard
- fix timezones thing problem

# Tolearns:
- fancy url forms
- actual substantial requests 
- blocks in templates if that's a thing
