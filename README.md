# Habitrack
I want to make a habit tracker for my 2024 annual goals. These goals are (ironically) going to start in February, because I will be using January to make this goal tracker.

# Todos:
- get selector either embedded or to have a back arrow to get there
- create summary pages
  - graphs
  - summary stats
  - comparison to goal
- maybe have a dashboard
- date timezone issue
- look of update page
- make update update and not just add a new one
- add habits
